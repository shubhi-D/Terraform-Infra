##Terraform:IaC tool

1.You define Terraform files in .tf
2.Terraform figures out what to create/delete/change.
3.Terraform remembers infra using state.(terraform.tfstate)
4.Terraform does not scan Azure blindly,it trust it state file.

##Core Terraform Commands

1. terraform init : Purpose- Prepare the folder
   -> Download Providers(plugins)
   -> Prepares BE.
   -> Creates .terraform/
   -> Creates .terraform.lock.hcl

   Rule: New folder, BE/Provider change :-init

2. terraform plan : Purpose- Preview
   ->Shows what terraform will do.
   ->Creates nothing,delete nothing.
    Symbols:
       + create
       - delete
       ~ change
    Rule : Never create without reading plan.

3. terraform apply : Purpose- Commit

    ->Actually talks to Azure.
    ->Create/Update/delete infra.
    ->writes to state.

    Rule: This is the most dangerous command.

4. terraform destroy: Purpose- Clear Teardown
   
   ->deletes only whats in the state.
   ->Never touches infra that is not owned by it's state file.
